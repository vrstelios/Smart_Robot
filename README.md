# Smart Robot

# Introduction
The <b>Robot</b> developed by me as an undergraduate student of the Department of Computer Science AUTH.

# Description Robot
The Robot was implemented in the SimBad libraries in order to be guided through a set of obstacles towards its goal, 
which will be defined by the projection of a luminaire (lamp) on the ground. The Robot has the potential to overtake obstacles to follow the path of the lines and to follow the light i.e. to reach its target and all these have been implemented with hierarchical  which means that the Robot can decide for itself what decision to make at any given time to reach the target.
